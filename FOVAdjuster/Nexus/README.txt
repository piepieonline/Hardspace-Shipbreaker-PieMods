Piepieonline's FOV and Helmet Adjuster

Adjustable FOV, and allows turning off the helmet overlay while leaving the HUD active.
Adjusting FOV also scales the helm overlay, damage overlays, and moves the tool belt lower to be out of sight.

Tested up to an FOV of 90, past that the offset and scale values will probably need adjusting.

Scaling overlays will almost certainly break on a game update.

Installation:

    Download the latest 64 bit (x64) version of BepInEx 5 (5.4.19 at time of writing) from https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases
    Extract into the same folder as "Shipbreaker.exe".
    Run the game, load the main menu and quit.
    Extract the mod to "BepInEx\plugins\", so you should have (for example) ".\BepInEx\plugins\FOVAdjuster\FOVAdjuster.dll"
    Modify the settings to your liking
