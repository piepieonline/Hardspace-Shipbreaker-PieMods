Piepieonline's Challenge Mode

A challenge mode designed to make you rush, and make quick decisions (...and mistakes).
Adds a work order to free play that must be completed (which could be any barge-able object), on a tighter timer (based on which ship and objects are selected).


Installation:

    Download the latest 64 bit (x64) version of BepInEx 5 (5.4.19 at time of writing) from https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases
    Extract into the same folder as "Shipbreaker.exe".
    Run the game, load the main menu and quit.
    Extract the mod to "BepInEx\plugins\", so you should have (for example) ".\BepInEx\plugins\UpgradeCostAdjuster\UpgradeCostAdjuster.dll"
    Modify the settings to your liking
